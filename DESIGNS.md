## Social
- Show people you crossed paths with.  Streetpass
  - Let people set the nature of their trip.  If you pass someone who is from canada on a huge trip, you should know it.  Highlight this fact, and use it to drive profile views.  It's interesting if you see someone who is on a trip as opposed to a commuter

# Milestone 1
- Concentrate on touring info, profile information




## Ideas about determining "distance until feature on road"

- Roads have a mile marker
- Steps:  determine what road you are on.  Determing what mile of road you are on. what direction you are heading.
- an attraction has a mile marker as well as some simple notation data like "exit 10b"
- Generating road data
  - 

## Determining if a given track point is "on track" with the master track
1.  Find the two nearest contiguous track points from the master track to the test track
1.  Find the distance to the line segment


## New 

- Historical information about the area
- Historical markers for achievements...  take a break at each historical marker to unlock
- Achievement collections... for example: altitude based achievements are grouped together.
